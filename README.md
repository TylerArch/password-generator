# 02 Password Generator

## Description
The motivation for this project was to create a random password generator. I incorporated strings, arrays, if statements, and loops to accomplish this. I heavily expanded on my JavaScript funtionality and am very happy with the result.

## Installation

Right clicking on the index.html and selecting "Open in default browser" will open the browser and  navigate to the Portfolio page.

## Usage

Clicking the Generate Password button will prompt you to enter the amount of characters you would like the password to be between 8 and 128.  If this is an invalid entry an alert is triggered and it loops until valid.
A confirm box will be shown to ask whether you would like to use lower case letters, upper case letter, special characters, and numbers. If at least one option is not selected an alert will appear and it will loop until a valid selection has been made.
A randomly generated password with the specified components will display in the text box.
